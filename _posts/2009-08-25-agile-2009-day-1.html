<p>For the first session I went to <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/2344">Developing Agile Leaders and Teams: A Developmental &amp; Transformational Path</a> with Gilles Brouillette, because I&#39;ve recently taken on a management-heavy role and my ideas on leadership are are, shall we say, unformed.&#0160; Gilles has a PhD in Transpersonal Psycology, and the session was heavy on what I can assume psychologists think about all day: questions about our perception of reality, and the models that we use to glean meaning from the world round us.&#0160; It was all rather deep.<br />His spent most of the 90 minutes building up a model of levels of physcological development.&#0160; The top three levels are apparently very rarely attained, but are where you need to be if you&#39;re going to be a successful leader.&#0160; So how do you get to these high levels of physiological development?&#0160; Apparently it&#39;s about changing the underlying way that you make sense of the world, from an &quot;OR&quot; model to an &quot;AND&quot; model.&#0160; It sounded to me like being able to hold more than possibility in your mind at the same time; a bit like understanding a smooth spectrum of probability rather than jumping to single binary outcome.</p>
