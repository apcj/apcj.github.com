<p>I&#39;m watching <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/presentation/When+the+Fur+Flies:+Dev+and+Ops+Cooperation+when+the+Worst+Happens">Michael Nygard&#39;s talk</a> in the <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=331">devops track</a> at QCon. &#0160;This is my first taste of the devops movement and it&#39;s certainly something I like the look of. &#0160;I&#39;m really struck by his assertion that we don&#39;t need a division between development and operations, but crucially he isn&#39;t saying that everyone needs the same skills - we will still have specialists.</p><p>I&#39;m struck that this idea of bringing people together into a single team, while still maintaining specialisation, comes up a lot in the software world. &#0160;Some examples:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>We always try to have a single User Story implemented by a single team. &#0160;There may be different specialist skills required to implement a single feature, but all those skills should be in the same team and the people should work together; we don&#39;t want a &quot;back end&quot; team and a &quot;front end&quot; team.</li>
<li>I&#39;m frequently explaining to clients the value of having QA specialists integrated within a development team.</li>
<li>More recently, with <a href="http://www.thekua.com/atwork/">Pat Kua</a>, I&#39;ve been arguing for the integration of performance testing into the development team.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p>Having a single team has all sorts of implications. &#0160;I&#39;m particularly keen on having a single backlog of work, even if not everybody has the skills to pull from that backlog. &#0160;Most importantly, a single team stands a better chance of having a single goal than do multiple teams.</p><p>Why are specialist teams so common in software? &#0160;My intuition is that it&#39;s a social phenomenon that people with similar skills and interests tend to congregate, and like working together. &#0160;Finding an effective mechanism to counteract this force, while still maintaining high-skill and specialisation, seems like a Social Technology (in Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s terminology) that organisations will need to acquire to be successful.</p>
