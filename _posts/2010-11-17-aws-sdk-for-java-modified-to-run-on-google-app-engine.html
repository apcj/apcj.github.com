title: AWS SDK for Java modified to run on Google App Engine
published: 1
---
<p>I&#39;ve been building a small experimental app on Google App Engine. &#0160;At some point in the summer the app outgrew the sensible but&#0160;onerous&#0160;restrictions of the GAE sandbox. &#0160;Specifically, I wanted to generate images larger than 1MB, and there is simply no way to do this from inside a GAE app. &#0160;This was quite a major speed bump.</p>
<p>Many months later, and I have the app managing a pool of AWS EC2 instances to do its image generation work. &#0160;The GAE app uses the AWS SDK for Java to start and stop EC2 instances, and to publish to an SQS queue. &#0160;It&#39;s working well.</p>
<p>However, getting to this point wasn&#39;t easy, because the official AWS SDK doesn&#39;t work in GAE. &#0160;That&#39;s because another of the GAE restrictions prevents applications from opening their own sockets. &#0160;All network activity should be channelled through Google&#39;s UrlFetchService. &#0160;If you use Java&#39;s lame URL API then this chanelling is transparent. But if, as in the AWS case, you are using full featured HTTP Client, some work is required. &#0160;There are various approaches for supporting Apache HttpClient, the most popular one being to provide it with fake socket-level connections, which parse the protocol emitted by the HttpClient and&#0160;reconstitute&#0160;enough information to be able to call UrlFetchService. &#0160;Noteably, <a href="http://apetresc.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/introducing-the-gae-aws-sdk-for-java/" target="_self">Adrian Petrescu</a> used this approach and <a href="https://github.com/apetresc/aws-sdk-for-java" target="_self">forked the official AWS SDK</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very grateful to Adrian for making this fork, bacause it gave me faith hat it was possible to do what I wanted to do. &#0160;And early on it worked well. &#0160;But I couldn&#39;t get it to call any of the SQS methods; I kept getting invalid signature errors, but using a client outside of GAE I was generating an identical signature and the requests were succeeding - it was baffling. &#0160;After a mammoth debugging session, including an outing for WireShark, I tracked down the problem: the fake HTTP Connection was throwing away the whole of the path for my HTTP requests so they didn&#39;t stand a chance of succeeding; the signature is just the first thing that AWS happens to check. &#0160;Looking at the source code I found an <a href="https://github.com/apetresc/aws-sdk-for-java/blob/master/src/main/java/domderrien/wrapper/UrlFetch/UrlFetchHttpConnection.java#L264" target="_self">ominous comment</a>&#0160;&quot;Other information are just ignored safely&quot;. &#0160;I hacked in a line of code to stop ignoring other information, and&#0160;miraculously&#0160;everything started working.&#0160;</p>
<p>I thought it would be&#0160;helpful&#0160;for me to fix this bug properly (with an accompanying test) and&#0160;submit&#0160;a patch, but it gradually dawned on me how many similar bugs could lurk in the code. &#0160;Afterall, this class should really understand the whole of the HTTP protocol. &#0160;Put off by the scale of the challenge, I decided to try an alternative approach. &#0160;I looked at the original AWS code, and it seemed pretty well isoalted already from HttpClient.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later and I had my own fork,&#0160;<a href="https://github.com/apcj/aws-sdk-for-java-on-gae" target="_self">aws-sdk-for-java-on-gae</a>. &#0160;This fork completely removes Apache HttpClient and hard-wires UrlFetchService in its place. &#0160;It turns out that UrlFetchService has a much better API than Apache HttpClient (at least a lot better than the 3.x version that Amazon used) so conversion was pretty straightforward. &#0160;I removed a fair bit code that was irrelavent&#0160;because&#0160;actual connections are&#0160;opaque&#0160;when you use UrlFetchService, so it&#39;s simpler as well!</p>
<p>It seems to be working fine for me so far, but I&#39;m sure somebody will find a similar bug somewhere, give up fixing it and make their own fork. &#0160;But in the meantime, give it a try!</p>
