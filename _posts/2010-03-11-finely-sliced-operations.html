<p>Since the previous post, I&#39;ve reading up more on the devops movement and found a few nice pieces, particularly <a href="http://www.darkskills.org.uk/diary/index.php?wl_mode=more&amp;wl_eid=147">Graham Bleach on internal borders</a>.</p><p>Thinking about borders within operations departments, I&#39;m reminded of a recent client who operated with a mind-blowing number of siloed operations teams. &#0160;Coming at it from the development side, working through a problem with the operations staff was like exploring a never-ending labyrinth of teams. &#0160;Every time I probed a little deeper, my contact would defer responsibility to another mysterious team, usually located somewhere distant, that owned a slightly lower level of the stack. &#0160;Once I tracked down a real person in the mysterious team, the same thing would happen again, and I would be left searching for another distant team. &#0160;It seemed like I would never actually get to the real hardware. &#0160;An unforeseen consequence of virtualization is that it allows someone to declare themselves in charge of a Virtual Machine, but not in charge of the host or guest operating systems nor the hardware itself - staggeringly unhelpful.</p><p>The genius of these extremely-finely-sliced organisations is that they provide innumerable cracks down which responsibility, ownership and useful work can fall. &#0160;If a team has a sufficiently narrow focus, it is almost certain that no problem will ever occur that falls cleanly within its boundaries, so there is no responsibility at all - a manager&#39;s dream.</p><p>One thing that encourages me a little bit is a recent trend for counting the number &quot;engineers&quot; in an organisation. &#0160;I think all technical staff are counted in this metric, though I&#39;m not sure whether people are including managers and other IT staff who might not be hands on. &#0160;In his <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/presentation/Facebook:+Architecture+and+Design">QCon talk</a>, Aditya Agarwal was very proud of Facebook&#39;s metric of 1.1 million users per engineer, while <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/presentation/Building+Skype.+Learnings+from+almost+five+years+as+a+Skype+Architect">Andres KÃ¼tt</a> was similarly proud of Skype&#39;s 600,000 users per <em>employee</em>. &#0160;Note that Facebook is very open about its number of engineers but secretive about its number of <em>employees</em> - I have no idea why. &#0160;I think counting the total number of technical staff is useful because helps people look at the broader cost of running software - not just development or just operations. &#0160;Also, I hope in the long term these kinds of metrics will highlight the painful inefficiency of silos and barriers.</p>
