title: Arrows are Beautiful - London D3 Meetup
published: 1

<p>
  On Tuesday last week I talked at the London D3 meetup. I showed off what I've been doing
  with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> to draw diagrams of graphs for presentations.
  I've been using my little <a href="https://github.com/apcj/arrows">suite of tools</a>
  to draw pictures for my <a href="http://www.apcjones.com/talks/">slide decks</a> since last Autumn,
  but this was the first time that I put together a deck that consists almost entirely of graphs.
  It was quite a fun style and I'm sure I'll be doing it again.
</p>

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 62.5%; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 20px">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; box-shadow: 0 0 5px 5px #DDDDDD;" src="http://www.apcjones.com/talks/2013-06-11_D3_London/"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
  <small>Move through the deck with cursor keys, or swipe on touch screens. <a href="http://www.apcjones.com/talks/2013-06-11_D3_London/" target="_blank">Pop-out</a> for a better view</small>

  Makoto did a write-up on the <a href="http://blog.new-bamboo.co.uk/2013/06/12/london-d3-js-meetup-5">
  New Bamboo blog</a>, and hopefully there'll also be a video up there soon.
