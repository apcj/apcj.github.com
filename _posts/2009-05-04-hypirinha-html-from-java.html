<p>For the first time in my career I&#39;ve been travelling to the office each day by train.&#0160; For some reason I find my time on the train extraordinarily productive, especially when I get my laptop out.&#0160; The first fruit of that productivity is a new open source project, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hypirinha/">hypirinha</a>.&#0160; From the project home page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypirinha is a Java library for generating HTML. Hypirinha follows the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html" rel="nofollow">fluent interface</a> style, whereby several method calls can be chained together as single statement to achieve the desired result. </p>
</blockquote><p>
I&#39;ve found the exercise really fun, and I think the the library will actually be useful.&#0160; At my current client we&#39;re using it for some minor reports and find it works well.&#0160; Using it on a large-scale web application is still some way off, but I think it&#39;s useful to challenge the usual template-based approach we see if we can find something better.</p>
