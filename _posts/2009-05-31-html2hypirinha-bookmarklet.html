<p>I&#39;ve been playing with the <a href="http://hypirinha.appspot.com/html2hypirinha">html2hypirinha</a> app for a few weeks now, and it&#39;s been very convenient to have a bookmarklet. Try dragging this to your Bookmarks Toolbar: <a href="javascript:location.href=&#39;http://hypirinha.appspot.com/html2hypirinha?url=&#39;+encodeURIComponent(location.href)">Convert to Hypirinha</a>.</p>
